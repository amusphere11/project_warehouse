```

## üîê Security Features

### Role-Based Access Control
- **ADMIN**: Full access to user management
- **MANAGER**: Cannot access user management
- **OPERATOR**: Cannot access user management

### Password Security
- Passwords are hashed using bcrypt (10 salt rounds)
- Passwords are never returned in API responses
- Password change requires current password verification

### Additional Security
- JWT-based authentication required for all endpoints
- Authorization middleware checks user role
- Users cannot delete themselves
- Soft delete preserves data integrity

## üì° API Endpoints

### User Management Endpoints

| Method | Endpoint | Auth | Description |
|--------|----------|------|-------------|
| GET | `/api/users` | ADMIN | Get all users (with pagination, search, filter) |
| GET | `/api/users/:id` | ADMIN | Get user by ID |
| POST | `/api/users` | ADMIN | Create new user |
| PUT | `/api/users/:id` | ADMIN | Update user |
| DELETE | `/api/users/:id` | ADMIN | Delete user (soft delete) |
| PUT | `/api/users/change-password` | Any | Change own password |

### For Developers

#### Backend: Add Audit Logging

The controller already includes audit logging:

```typescript
// Audit log is automatically created on:
// - User creation
// - User update
// - User deletion

// Example audit log entry:
{
  action: 'CREATE_USER',
  performedBy: currentUserId,
  details: { userId, email, name, role }
}
```

#### Frontend: Customize Table Columns

Edit `frontend/src/pages/Users.tsx`:

```typescript
const columns: GridColDef[] = [
  // Add custom columns here
  {
    field: 'customField',
    headerName: 'Custom',
    width: 150,
  },
  // ... existing columns
];
```

#### Add New User Roles

1. Update Prisma schema:
```prisma
enum UserRole {
  ADMIN
  MANAGER
  OPERATOR
  SUPERVISOR  // New role
}
```

2. Run migration:
```bash
cd backend
npx prisma migrate dev --name add_supervisor_role
```

3. Update frontend components to include new role

## üß™ Testing

### Manual Testing Checklist

- [ ] Login as ADMIN
- [ ] Access Users page from menu
- [ ] Create new user
- [ ] Verify user appears in list
- [ ] Edit user details
- [ ] Change user role
- [ ] Deactivate user
- [ ] Search for user by name

  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN"

# Create user
curl -X POST "http://localhost:3000/api/users" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN" \

  -d '{
    "email": "test@example.com",
    "name": "Test User",
    "password": "Test1234!",
    "role": "OPERATOR",
    "isActive": true
  }'

# Update user
curl -X PUT "http://localhost:3000/api/users/USER_ID" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "name": "Updated Name",
    "role": "MANAGER"
  }'

# Delete user
curl -X DELETE "http://localhost:3000/api/users/USER_ID" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN"
```

## üìä Database Schema

### User Table
```prisma
model User {
  id          String   @id @default(uuid())
  email       String   @unique
  password    String
  name        String
  role        UserRole @default(OPERATOR)
  isActive    Boolean  @default(true)
  createdAt   DateTime @default(now())
  updatedAt   DateTime @updatedAt
  
  // Relations
  transactions        InventoryTransaction[]
  performedAuditLogs  AuditLog[]            @relation("PerformedBy")
  targetedAuditLogs   AuditLog[]            @relation("TargetUser")
}

enum UserRole {
  ADMIN
  MANAGER
  OPERATOR
}
```

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### "Cannot access Users menu"
- **Solution**: Ensure you're logged in as ADMIN role

#### "Failed to fetch users"
- **Solution**: Check backend is running and accessible
- Check browser console for errors
- Verify token is valid

#### "Cannot create user - email already exists"
- **Solution**: Use a unique email address

#### "Password too short"
- **Solution**: Use at least 8 characters for password

#### "Cannot delete user"
- **Solution**: You cannot delete yourself. Use another ADMIN account

### Debug Mode

Enable detailed logging:

```typescript
// Backend: Add to user.controller.ts
console.log('User operation:', { action, userId, data });

// Frontend: Check browser console
// All API calls are logged automatically
```

## üìù Best Practices

### Security
